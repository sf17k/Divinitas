Divinitas: Genesis
==================
About
-----
Divinitas is a project which aims to generate voxel worlds which have realistic geology and ecosystems. The primary way it intends to accomplish this is through the use of plate tectonics for the process of terrain generation.

It's first and foremost application is the export of said voxel worlds to a Minecraft world format (currently Anvil region file format).
